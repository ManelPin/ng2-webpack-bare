#Bare-Bones Angular 2 & Webpack Configuration

## What is This?

I needed a bare-bones version of Angular 2 & Webpack to use so I could create new projects.
So I made this. And, if you're reading this, you can use it too.

## To-Dos

While the base idea requires no more work, I'd like to make it easier on me to create new
components, services, etc. This will entail scripts to:

1. Generate a new README file & package.json
2. Scaffold a new component with unit test
3. Scaffold a new service with unit test
